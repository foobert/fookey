Hey future me,

this is the repo where you can get your public key.

To help you with recovering the private key from the QR printouts, have a look
at the [heads.txt](heads.txt).

There's a [dockerfile](duplicity) which should contain everything to recover
your password safe. You should be able to pull a pre-built image from
[foobert/duplicity](https://hub.docker.com/r/foobert/duplicity/).
